SimpliciTI-mspgcc-1.2.0
=======================

Trying to figure out compilation of SimpliciTI under mspgcc for Launchpad with msp430g2553 and a 2500 radio

Based mostly on ideas and code from _senstools: http://senstools.gforge.inria.fr/doku.php?id=lib:simpliciti
however,  this somehow did not compile cleanly for me.

The base idea is to give SimpliciTI to Launchpad board with msp430g2553 chip, using cheap ebay/aliexpress RF2500 radios.
